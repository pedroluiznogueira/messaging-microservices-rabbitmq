# RabbitMQ

# Running it on localhost:15672
-> go to C:\Program Files\RabbitMQ Server\rabbitmq_server-3.9.11\sbin
-> ls to see all .bat scripts files
-> rabbitmq-plugins.bat enable rabbitmq_management
-> you can enable/disable it
-> go to localhost:15672 
-> username: guest and password: guest

# What is message and why we need it ?
-> SOAP protocol has message, header and body
-> asynchronous, different for a synchronous http request
-> example:
-> customers messages, orders comming in a huge load
-> we can process them one by one
-> we use advanced messaging to encapsulate any kind of information
-> queues, topics, channels, exchanges, depends on the protocol definition

# Messaging Protocols
-> most used are STOMP, MQTT and MQP
-> STOMP is a text-oriented messaging protocols (simple messages)
-> MQTT macchine to machine
-> AMQP is advanced messaging protocols protocol

# What AMQP solves ?
-> completely different systems to exchange messages
-> vendor A publishes the message to broker and vendor B receives the message from broker  
-> diverse programming languages can communicate easily
-> enables messaging as a cloud service

# RabbitMQ features
-> supports clustering for fault tolerance and scalability
-> multiple connections in a single TCP connection
-> delegate less process

# Actors of Messaging
-> producer produces a message eich is sent to a exchange
-> through the exchange the message is routed to a queue
-> a consumer recieves the messages from the queue

# Exchanges
-> first to receive the message
-> routes a message to one or more queue
-> routing algorithms dependes on exchange types and "bidings"
-> "biding" is nothing more than a configuration to bind exchanges to queues
-> types:
->
-> direct = empty string and amq.direct
-> fanout = amq.fanout
-> topic = amq.topic (user purchased, for example)
-> headers = amq.match and amq.headers

# Queues
-> messages arrive from exchanges to queues
-> where messages go after reaching a subscriber
-> properties:
-> 
-> name: name of the queue
-> durable: either to persist to disk or not
-> exclusive: delete the queue if not used anymore
-> auto-delete: delete the queue when consumer unsubscribes

# Topics
-> the "subject" of a message
-> they are routing_key to the messages
-> special format "app.logs.error" (application logging error)
-> optional parameters for message exchange
-> you can send and receive messages without topics
-> with no topic it goes to default exchanges and queue
-> topics exchanges are defined with topic messages

# Bidings
-> rules that exchanges use to route messages to queues --important--
-> from exchange E to queue K, K has to be bound to E
-> may have an optional routing key attribute used by some exchange types
-> routing_key acts like a filter
-> queue is a destination city
-> exchanges are like the airport of this city
-> bidings are the routes to arrive from the airport to the city
-> there can be zero or many routes possible to reach it

# What if the message can't be routed to the queue ?
-> imagine there are no bidings for the exchange the message was published to
-> the message is either dropped or returned to the publisher
-> it depends on the message attributes the publisher has set
-> publisher attributes are very useful

# Main difference between RabbitMQ and Kafka
-> kafka has descentralized broker 
-> brokerless, distributed or cloud based
